# RSCAD-Automation-Using-Python

Python has been used to Automate RSCAD ,which is the software to handle RTDS(Real Time Digital Simulator).
A user only needs to fill the test configuration data in Excel sheet and load it to python and then the user can run the test sequences either manually or automatically.
Using this concept the testing can be performed both locally and remotely.
